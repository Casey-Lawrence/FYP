This week, I completed the feasibility study (questions 1–10) and created a questionnaire to get user opinions and needs regarding turbulence prediction. The questions included:

How often do you fly per year? (0–4, 4–10, 10+)
How concerned are you about turbulence on a scale of 1–10 (1 = not concerned, 10 = extremely concerned)?
Do you currently use any apps or websites to check turbulence before flying? (Yes/No)
How useful would it be to see flight-specific turbulence forecasts? (1 = not useful, 10 = extremely useful)
Which type of information would you prefer? (Timeline prediction, visual maps, comfort rating, other)
Would calming tips or exercises in an app be helpful? (Yes/No)
How much time before a flight would you check turbulence information? (1–6 hr, 6–12 hr, 12–24 hr, 24–36 hr)
What features would make you most likely to use a turbulence prediction app regularly? (Simple, easy-to-understand interface; practical tips for staying comfortable during turbulence; ability to check turbulence for multiple flights/routes; access to historical data)
How much detail about turbulence would you like? (In-depth information vs. brief overview)
Would you be interested in comparing turbulence levels between different flights or routes before booking? (Yes/No/Maybe)

From the responses:

Most participants are infrequent flyers (0–4 flights per year) and are more concerned about turbulence, though some regular flyers also expressed concern.
Almost all respondents currently do not use apps or websites to check turbulence. However, most think it would be very useful to see flight-specific forecasts, especially within 1–6 hours before a flight.
Preferred information includes comfort ratings, visual maps, timeline predictions, and practical tips or calming exercises to manage anxiety.
Key desired features include a simple, easy-to-use interface, the ability to check multiple flights/routes, and access to historical turbulence data.
Most users want just a basic overview, though highly concerned flyers would like more in-depth details.
There is strong interest in comparing turbulence across flights or routes before booking.

Insights:
This shows there is a clear need for an app that provides quick, easy-to-understand turbulence information, helps users feel more comfortable, and allows them to plan for calmer flights.

Supervisor Discussion &amp; Next Steps:
I spoke with my supervisor about my project. He advised that I focus on identifying the most valuable data and establishing a ground truth, which will serve as the reference for training my machine learning model.

We also discussed the potential for achieving a 1:1 in my final year project. He explained that this is possible if I integrate complexity into the project and execute it thoroughly. He suggested looking at the NOAA world map interface as inspiration(as i had told him i was looking at that but it was very complex) but adapting it to be suitable for general users rather than meteorologists or pilots.&nbsp;

If I can construct a metric from EDR/turbulence data and have it run on a schedule (every 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 6 hours), I can evaluate how far in advance it is possible to predict turbulence with reasonable accuracy (e.g., 85–95%). The main goal is to determine whether I can warn passengers of expected turbulence before their flights.

Research into potential ground truth sources may include weather observation balloons or drones.

Useful Data Sources to Research:

PIREPs/AIREPs: Pilot/aircraft reports (North Atlantic flights, U.S.)

SIGMETs: Worldwide aviation warnings

TAFs: Worldwide forecast conditions

METARs: Worldwide current conditions

Official sources:

I was able to extract some data from these sources, but this week I will focus on gathering meaningful data that can serve as my ground truth and be used to train my model, to ensure it is fully feasible.
