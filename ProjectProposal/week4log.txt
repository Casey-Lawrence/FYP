Since FYP lecture on 06/10/2025, my idea has completely changed. I originally based my idea of what I thought good projects were in previous years and make it from scratch myself with improvements. But one of the lecturers said that we should do something that we actually enjoy otherwise you wont enjoy doing your project. 
So immediately I started jotting down things I am interested in, one big thing is aviation. So, I had an idea to create an application aimed towards anxious flyers, where they can enter their flight number and they’ll get a comfort score, showing if there will be turbulence and how bad it’ll be, if its bad, it could be a good idea to have some resources to reassure the user. 
So since then, I have researched other platforms that have the same concept and looked at how they display the information. As far as I can tell, it hasn’t been done for a Final Year Project in TUD, so It might be nice to have some different fresh project for marking. 
Although I like my idea, I am going to complete the feasibility study this week,  and then meet with my supervisor. I am not going to get tied to the idea yet as It might not be complex enough , so ill take any recommendations that is given to me by my supervisor and other lecturers
